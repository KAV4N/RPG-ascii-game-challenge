<h1>RPG ASCII Game Challenge</h1>

<p>Welcome to the RPG ASCII Game Challenge repository! This project is aimed at creating a simple text-based RPG game with ASCII graphics. The initial version is implemented in Python and features random world generation, roads, random rooms, and character movement. The game runs on the default command line interface (Terminal, Command Prompt, PowerShell), making it easily accessible for all users.</p>

<h2>Python Version</h2>

<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Random World Generation:</strong> Explore a dynamically generated world with each playthrough, making every game unique.</li>
    <li><strong>Roads:</strong> Navigate through roads that connect different parts of the world, adding structure to your journey.</li>
    <li><strong>Random Rooms:</strong> Encounter various randomly generated rooms as you explore the world, each with its own unique characteristics.</li>
    <li><strong>Character Movement:</strong> Move your character within the ASCII world, discovering new locations and challenges.</li>
    <li><strong>Enemy Encounters:</strong> Encounter enemies in the world, creating combat scenarios for the player.</li>
    <li><strong>Flashlight weapon: </strong> Collect Flashlight in the "boss rooms" to light up your way.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Controls:</h3>
<p>Use the arrow keys for character movement:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Up Arrow:</strong> Move Up</li>
    <li><strong>Down Arrow:</strong> Move Down</li>
    <li><strong>Left Arrow:</strong> Move Left</li>
    <li><strong>Right Arrow:</strong> Move Right</li>
    <li><strong>Press 'F' to use Weapon:</strong> Uses the selected Weapon</li>
    <li><strong>Press 'Q' to Exit:</strong> Exit the game</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Run:</h3>
<p>To run the game, open a command prompt or terminal window in the project directory and type the following command:</p>
<code>python main.py</code>
</br>


<h3>Future Improvements:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Quests and Objectives:</strong> Implement quests and objectives to give players a purpose and direction in the game. (For now the current objective is not to get blocked by enemies.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>The next step in this project is to recreate the game in C++ and Java. This transition aims to reinforce programming concepts, improve code efficiency, and explore the nuances of a different programming language.</p>
